I will assume the requirements and i will do exploratory testing.

Exploratory testing - Understanding the application, identify the all scenarios, document the scenarios and test the software is called as exploratory testing.

how would i test this setup
---------------------------
--> I will understand the application & i will try to enter all possible inputs to each & every components & i will do exploratory testing.
--> I will understand the application & check data flow between the modules by doing exploratory testing
--> I will explore the application & i will understand how each & every feature works & i will try to test for all possible end to end scenarios by doing exploratory testing.

High level strategies are,
---------------------------
--> Before testing starts, it is neccessary to identify & document the scenarios in a quantofiable manner.
--> Specifying the objectives of testing in a clear & detailed manner.

Priorities,
-----------
--> Requirement based : Some requirements are more important than others or more critical in nature, so test cases for such requirements should be prioritize first.
--> Coverage based test case : Test cases are prioritized on the basis of thier code coverage.
--> Risk Based : This technique users risk analysis to identify potential problem areas which if failed, could lead to bad consequences.

Scenarios
---------
FAN
----
1) To check that whether the fan is ceiling fan or table fan
2) To check that number of blades on the fan
3) To check that ON-OFF functionality of fan 
4) To check that fan works normally throws wing on the right direction 
5) To check that materil of the fan parts are made
6) To check that voltage requirement of the fan 
7) To check that maximum speed of the fan 
8) To check that minimum speed of the fan
9) To check that length of the fan rod and blades 
10) To check that weight of the fan is as per the specifications
11) To check that colour of the fan is as per the specifications
12) To check that fans condition when continiously switched on for very large duration

BULB
----
1) To check that Type of bulb
2) To check that voltage requiremnet of the bulb 
3) To check that ON-OFF functionality of bulb
4) To check that Brightness of the bulb 
5) To check that material used or outer body of the bulb
6) To check that on supplying specified power supply, Bulb gets on after pressing switch button upwards
7) To check that bulb gets off after pressing switch button downwards 
8) To check that bulb switch button perform there functioning correctly
